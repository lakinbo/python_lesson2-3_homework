# Write a Python program that calculates movie ticket costs with different pricing.

# Requirements:

# Ask the user for their name and age
# Set ticket prices: 
    # Child (under 13): $8
    # Adult(13âˆ’64):$12
    # Senior (65+): $9
# Ask how many tickets they want (Ticket prices should be calculated based on the age of the person buying them)
# Calculate total cost and display a receipt-style output
# Use f-string formatting for the receipt
