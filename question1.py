# Write a Python program that calculates movie ticket costs with different pricing.

# Requirements:

# Ask the user for their name and age
# Set ticket prices: 
    # Child (under 13): $8
    # Adult(13âˆ’64):$12
    # Senior (65+): $9
# Ask how many tickets they want (Ticket prices should be calculated based on the age of the person buying them)
# Calculate total cost and display a receipt-style output
# Use f-string formatting for the receipt

name = input("Name: ")
age = int(input("Age: "))
quantity = int(input("How many tickets do you want?"))

ticket_price = 0

if age < 13:
    ticket_type = "Child"
    ticket_price = 8
elif age <= 64:
    ticket_type = "Adult"
    ticket_price = 12
else:
    ticket_type = "Senior"
    ticket_price = 9

print("=== MOVIE TICKET RECEIPT ===")
print(f"Customer: {name}")
print(f"Ticket Type: {ticket_type} (${ticket_price:.2f} each)")
print(f"Quantity: {quantity}")
print(f"Total Cost: ${ticket_price * quantity:.2f}")
